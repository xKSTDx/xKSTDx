### 🔧 "Skills"
My arsenal to fight the Matrix:

- **🟨 JavaScript**: Chaos Is my framework.
- **🐍 Python**: Fast typing, slow af.
- **🦀 Rust**: ½ faster, 100+ lines.
- **🐳 Docker**: Tear containers.
- **💾 SQL**: My data, my religion.

### 📈 Real stats
```
Useful commits: 0
"Fixed typo" commits: 999+
Times I broke my linux distro: Can't remember
Times I blamed the computer: All of them
Tests written: What's that?
```

### 💡 Lessons learned
- "Works on my machine" is a religion
- The best code is the one someone else wrote
- If there are no console errors, it's fine (lie)
- Users always find creative ways to break everything
